EtherShield28j60 Arduino Library
--------------------------------

An Arduino 1.0 library to support ethernet shields based on the Microchip ENC28J60 MAC/PHY, such as the SeedStudio Ethernet Shield v1.1

This library is, almost verbatim, the same library found at http://www.nuelectronics.com/estore/index.php?main_page=project_eth.

The only modifications added are to create compatibility with Arduino 1.0. See source code for license information (GPL V2) and credits.
